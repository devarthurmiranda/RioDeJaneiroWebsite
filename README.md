<h2 align="center"> About </h2>
<p align="center"> The frontend was never an area of comfort for me. With that in mind, I decided to make an entire project focused on the stylization of a screen for a fictitious travel agency, putting a lot of effort in the choice of each element, such as colors, positioning, responsiveness, etc. I hope you enjoy it, any feedback is welcome! </p>
